XR Sample App Framework
=======================

This framework is provided as a sample and is not intended for production
code. No guarantees or warranties are provided.


## Built in resources

By default the built-in resources (textures or shaders) are not recompiled
when the framework is built. The rebuilding can be forced by setting the
XRAF_REBUILD_RESOURCES environment variable to 1.

### Unix Like

```sh
export XRAF_REBUILD_RESOURCES=1
```

### Windows:

```sh
set XRAF_REBUILD_RESOURCES=1
```
